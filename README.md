# Railway-Reservation-System
A console-based Railway Reservation System developed in Java that allows users to book, cancel, and view train tickets. The system uses a menu-driven interface and file handling to store passenger data. It simulates real-world railway booking operations and reinforces object-oriented programming and modular design.
